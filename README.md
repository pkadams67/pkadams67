![Hello ðŸ‘‹](https://i.imgur.com/YT2vTF6.jpg)

Hello, Iâ€™m Paul.
===

Iâ€™m a Mobile Development Manager based near Music City, USA. At age ten, I keypunched a tic-tac-toe game in Fortran. That led to learning AppleSoft BASIC and other compiled languages. For seven years, I coded almost exclusively in Swift, reviewed Kotlin, and scripted as needed for other compilers. Nowadays, however, I tend to focus more on administrative duties.

Iâ€™ve collaborated on 200+ among 14 different App Store categories. Itâ€™s a fantastic feeling knowing my code has been in the hands of more than 1.7 million users.

Iâ€™m a proud spouse, parent of three, and grandparent of two. When not coding, I enjoy wrangling our [Weimaraner](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/weimaraner), live music, and [Crimson Tide Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football).
