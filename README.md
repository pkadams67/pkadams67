## Hello, I’m Paul.

Thanks for visiting my profile! My programming journey ignited when I crafted a Fortran tic-tac-toe game at age ten. This led me to explore multiple programming languages.

For over seven years, I specialized in mobile app development. In 2019, I transitioned to leadership, drawing from my unique U.S. Army Ranger background and counseling psychology expertise to shape high-performing teams. I’ve contributed to 200+ projects across various markets, reaching millions of users.

Beyond tech, I cherish family time with my spouse, three children, and three grandchildren. My lively [Weimaraner](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/weimaraner) keeps things exciting. I also revel in live music, [travel adventures](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=17xvqfTc_OMc9VCa3vX-LsG3JqfC43mo&usp=sharing), and fervently support the [Crimson Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football) on the gridiron.
