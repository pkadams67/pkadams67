![Hello ðŸ‘‹](https://i.imgur.com/P0SiUoU.jpg)

Hello, Iâ€™m Paul.
===

Iâ€™m a Nashville area software developer who creates apps and practical solutions for the Apple platform. My introduction to programming began as a preteen, coding a tic-tac-toe game in Fortran. That led to learning AppleSoft BASIC and other compiled languages, starting an enduring passion for writing software that simplifies and delights our everyday lives.

Today, I mostly work in Swift, coding as needed in others such as Objective-C, Ruby, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Over the years, I had the honor of working with several class-leading software companies, collaborating on over 200 titles among a dozen different App Store categories. Itâ€™s a remarkable feeling knowing my code has been in the hands of more than a million users.
