Hello, I’m Paul.
===

I’m a Nashville area software developer who creates apps and practical solutions for the Apple platform. I’ve had the honor of working with several class-leading software companies, collaborating on over 200 titles among a dozen different App Store categories. It’s a remarkable feeling knowing my code has been in the hands of more than a million users.
