Hello, Iâ€™m Paul.
===

Iâ€™m a Nashville area software developer who creates apps and practical solutions for the Apple platform. Iâ€™ve had the honor of working with several class-leading software companies, collaborating on over 200 titles among a dozen different App Store categories. Itâ€™s a remarkable feeling knowing my code has been in the hands of more than a million users.
