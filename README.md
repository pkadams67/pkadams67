![Hello 👋](https://i.imgur.com/kFXufmS.jpeg)

## Hello, I’m Paul.

I’ve been building and leading critical systems most of my life. My introduction to computing came early, keypunching a Fortran tic-tac-toe program on a UNIVAC mainframe in the late ‘70s. Since then, I’ve focused on technology that works when it matters.

I spent 16 years in the U.S. Army, serving in airborne and Special Forces units, earning my [Ranger Tab](https://www.army.mil/ranger), and leading secure IT operations in high-risk environments. I managed mission-critical infrastructure for combat, counterterrorism, and humanitarian operations, delivering 99.998% uptime under pressure. That experience shaped how I view systems, risk, accountability, and leadership.

After military service, I earned a degree in psychology and completed graduate coursework in counseling. That background informs how I lead engineering organizations today, building psychologically safe teams that stay cohesive under pressure. I returned to hands-on technology through iOS development in 2015, then moved into engineering leadership, building teams, platforms, and operating models that scale.

Today, I lead mobile engineering at [iSeatz](https://www.iseatz.com), supporting large-scale travel loyalty platforms for American Express Card Members. My work spans platform architecture, mobile delivery at enterprise scale, and systems that serve millions of users and process billions of transactions in regulated environments.

Outside work, I spend time with my wife, family, and our [Weimaraner](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/weimaraner), enjoying live music, [travel](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?mid=17xvqfTc_OMc9VCa3vX-LsG3JqfC43mo&ll=23.179006731910512%2C-39.19093074793049&z=3), and Alabama football.
