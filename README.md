![Hello ðŸ‘‹](https://i.imgur.com/hfDTfji.jpg)

## Hello, Iâ€™m Paul.

Iâ€™ve been passionate about technology since age 10, when I developed a Fortran tic-tac-toe game. This sparked a lifelong interest in programming and led me to explore multiple languages. After seven years in mobile app development, I transitioned to leadership in 2019, where I draw on my U.S. Army Ranger background and counseling psychology expertise to guide high-performing teams.

With experience across 200+ projects, Iâ€™ve helped build products that reach millions of users. Outside work, I enjoy spending time with my wife, three children, four grandchildren, and our lively [Weimaraner](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/weimaraner). Iâ€™m also passionate about live music, [travel](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=17xvqfTc_OMc9VCa3vX-LsG3JqfC43mo&usp=sharing), and cheering on the [Crimson Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football).
