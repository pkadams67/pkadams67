## Hello, I’m Paul.

My passion for technology began at the age of 10, when I keypunched a Fortran tic-tac-toe game on a UNIVAC Series 90 in 1977. That early brush with “Big Iron” stuck with me.

I served 16 years in the U.S. Army, progressing through Airborne and Special Operations assignments and earning my [Ranger Tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_School) in 1995. I directed secure IT operations in high-stakes environments, leading teams that achieved 99.999% uptime on mission-critical infrastructure.

After my military service, I earned a degree in psychology and pursued graduate study in counseling, then re-entered the tech industry through [DevMountain’s](https://devmountain.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com) iOS boot camp in 2015. Four years of mobile development led me to engineering leadership in 2019, where my background in behavioral healthcare helps me coach and grow high-performing teams.

Today, I lead mobile engineering at [iSeatz](https://www.iseatz.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com), where our platform supports over $9 billion in travel loyalty experiences for [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) card members. I’ve built mobile platforms that reach millions of users and scaled fintech systems that process billions of transactions.

Outside of work, you’ll find me with my wife and family, our lively [Weimaraner](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/weimaraner?utm_source=chatgpt.com), at [live music](https://www.songkick.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), exploring [new places](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=17xvqfTc_OMc9VCa3vX-LsG3JqfC43mo&usp=sharing&utm_source=chatgpt.com), or cheering on the [Crimson Tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
